## What Is Server Portal?

Server Portal is a Node.js, Express, React, and Tailwind CSS application for managing a Plex or Jellyfin media server community. It stores runtime data in local JSON files, so it does not require a database.

Use these docs when you need to install the app, configure integrations, run it in Docker, operate background tasks, or understand the project structure.

## Integration Highlights

Server Portal supports Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Tautulli, Jellystat, Jellyseerr, Overseerr, Ombi, Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Bazarr, qBittorrent, Transmission, BitTorrent, Deluge, SABnzbd, Gotify, TMDB, and SMTP.

See the full [integration list](/guide/integrations) for setup notes and feature coverage.

## Quick Commands

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

For production Docker deployments, start with the [Docker guide](/guide/docker).
