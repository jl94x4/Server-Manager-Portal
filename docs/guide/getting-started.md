# Getting Started

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.6 or newer for native `.env` support.
- A Plex Media Server with an admin Plex token, or a Jellyfin/Emby server with an admin API key.
- An SMTP provider if you want automated email notifications.

## Install Locally

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jl94x4/Server-Manager-Portal.git
cd Server-Manager-Portal
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with a signing secret:

```bash
printf 'JWT_SECRET=%s\n' "$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))")" > .env
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

`npm start` builds Tailwind CSS, bundles the React frontend with esbuild, stamps the version file, and starts the Express server on port `2121`.

Open `http://localhost:2121` and complete the setup wizard.

## First-Time Setup

The setup wizard asks you to choose a media server mode:

| Mode | Authentication | Analytics Companion | Branding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plex | Plex.tv OAuth, Plex token, selected owned server | Tautulli | Plex or custom theme |
| Jellyfin | Jellyfin username/password or Quick Connect | Jellystat | Jellyfin server assets or custom theme |
| Emby | Emby-compatible server connection | Optional external analytics/status tools | Emby or custom theme |

After setup, use the Settings area to configure the media server, SMTP, temporary access, branding, status services, integrations, home layout, and scheduled tasks.

## Runtime Data

Runtime data is written to `config/` by default. Docker deployments mount this directory to `/app/config`.

Important files include:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config/config.json` | Server and portal configuration |
| `config/users.json` | Portal user records |
| `config/audit-log.json` | System action history |
| `config/trending-cache.json` | Cached analytics and trending data |
| `config/analytics-cache.json` | Cached dashboard analytics |

Older root-level JSON files are migrated into `config/` automatically on startup when the destination file does not already exist.
